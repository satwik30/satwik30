- 👋 Hi, I’m @satwik30  
  I'm a final-year BTech student in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Applied Machine Learning. I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, especially in the areas of AI, healthcare, and road safety.

- 👀 I’m interested in  
  - Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning  
  - Computer Vision and Real-Time Detection Systems  
  - Full-Stack Web Development  
  - Smart Mobility & Safety Solutions  
  - Data Science & Predictive Analytics  
  - Research and Innovation in Deep Learning

- 🌱 I’m currently learning  
  - YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and surveillance applications  
  - Transformer-based models (Hugging Face, BERT) for NLP and embedding-based systems  
  - Blockchain fundamentals for secure and transparent digital systems  
  - Advanced deployment techniques with Django and cloud platforms

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on  
  - AI/ML-based projects that impact real lives (healthcare, safety, sustainability)  
  - Open-source tools focused on data processing, computer vision, or automation  
  - Innovative startups or research labs working on cutting-edge technology  
  - Building web apps that integrate machine learning into user-friendly platforms
